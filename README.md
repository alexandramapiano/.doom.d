My personal config based on Vanilla (GNU) Emacs - without Doom Emacs or Spacemacs

So far, no evil

Commits are slow as I mainly use the master branch (w/ Doom Emacs).

## Install

* Back up your .emacs.d directory is you have one

`git clone --branch vanilla https://github.com/earne/yikes.git ~/.emacs.d`
